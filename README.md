LIPS - Link to Itinerating Prepaid SIM-Cards

LIPS is a HTML/PHP-Platform which allows users to anonymously exchange prepaid SIM-Cards and cell phones 
in order to achieve anonymity (pseudonymity) for phone calls, sms and mobile internet. The website should 
be configured as a hidden service inside TOR.
